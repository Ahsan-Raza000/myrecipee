Excited to share my latest Android project built using Kotlin! I developed an app that fetches food category data from TheMealDB API and displays it in a user-friendly way.it is a simple app which
is made using these concepts:
JSON parsing
Retrofit for seamless networking
HTTP requests
RESTful APIs
Always learning and improving, and looking forward to applying these skills in future projects! ðŸ’» #AndroidDevelopment #Kotlin #Retrofit #RESTfulAPIs #JSON #LearningByDoing
